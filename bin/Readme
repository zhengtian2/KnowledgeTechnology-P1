Java file 
1.to run the project please moderate the path in readFileByLines(String P1,String P2,String P3,double P4) in both ReadFile.java and ReadFile2.java
 	P1,P2,P3 are all string:
 	P1  is the file path of query, 
   	P2 is the file path of tweets, 
   	P3 is the directory path that the output txt file will be generated.
	P4 is the similarity value you want to fill. The range is from 0 to 1. 0 is the least similar, while 1 is the most similar.
	
2.There are 5 java files in this project hereunder:
	ReadFile.java =======>edit distance approach
	ReadFile2.java ======> 2-grams approach
	editdistance.java=====>algorithm of edit distance
	n_gram2.java==========>algorithm of 2-gram
	Print.java============>generate txt result
	/*****NB:  Only 'ReadFile.java' and 'ReadFile2.java' are needed to get the result.But all other java files are a necessity to
	run these two java files.****/
3.The console output is not consistent with 'txt' file generated by the program by intention.The console output is only for testing purposes.
